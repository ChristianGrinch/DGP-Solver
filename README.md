# WORK IN PROGRESS!!
Heads up, I'm not sure what I'm doing or if any if this is right, so good luck if you're trying to use it.
When I refer to part of speech, I'll normally write pos.
The code is being actively migrated from code.org which uses a different version of javascript. The code for Ver. 1 is done and Ver. 2 is being worked on.

Version 1 of this app is able to check the pos of a word based off a given dictionary that has a bunch of words and their most common POS.
Version 2 is in the works and will be able to use logic to defer what type of pos each word is using context in the sentence and using version 1 as a 'baseline' to check against to help infer which pos the word probably is. 

# Benefits
### Version 1
- Allows you to get a rough estimation of what the POS is for each word in the sentence
### Version 2
