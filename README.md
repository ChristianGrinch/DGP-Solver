WORK IN PROGRESS!!
Heads up, I'm not sure what I'm doing or if any if this is right, so good luck if you're trying to use it.
When I refer to part of speech, I normally write pos/POS.

also, i'm currently in the midst of migrating all this code from code.org into this repository which is easier said than done

version 1 of this app will be able to check the part of speech of a word based off a given dictionary that has a bunch of words and their most common POS.
version 2 is in the works and will be able to use logic to defer what type of POS each word is using context in the sentence and using version 1 as a 'baseline' to check against
